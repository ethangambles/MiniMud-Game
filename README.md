# MiniMud-Game
This is a text based MiniMud video game where the player has to find the correct item and place it in the correct room.

There are three included scenarios - cat.txt, dog.txt, and lunch.txt. By running the program and typing the filename without the extension, the game will begin. 

The commands that the player can use are implemented in the 'Project2.cpp" file, and the functions that allow the game to run are implemented in the 'gameutils.cpp' file. 

The header files were provided by Professor Kevin Joiner, and the implementations were made by me, Ethan Gamble.
